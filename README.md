## Image Processing

A small example of image processing techniques with a focus on convolution:

* Grayscaling
* Color Inversion
* Edge Detection (Sobel, Laplacian)
* Gaussian Blur
* Fast Fourier Transform

### Installation

Open `index.html` in your browser and select a picture from your hard drive, no fuss.

Note: The FFT algorithm only works on image dimensions that are powers of 2 (e.g. 512x512).
